##Star Chess

Three years ago, I began developing a game called Star Chess. It was a strategy board game designed for Windows. Before completing its AI, Star Chess's development went on hiatus.

Now, Star Chess is back in development, being updated for the modern, mobile gaming world! Once a few things have been changed to make mobile gaming more convenient, version 1 will release; version 2 will allow networked multiplayer games to play with friends and maybe even random people over the internet!
